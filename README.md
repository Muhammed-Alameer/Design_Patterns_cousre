# Design_Patterns_cousre
This repository summarizes my learning for Programming Foundations: Design Patterns course which overviewed as Design patterns are reusable solutions that solve the challenges software developers face over and over again. Rather than reinventing the wheel, learn how to make use of these proven and tested patterns that will make your software more flexible and resilient to change. This course introduces you to design patterns and takes you through several of the most used object-oriented patterns. Elisabeth Robson and Eric Freeman, coauthors of Head First Design Patterns, join forces to provide an overview of each pattern and examples of the pattern in action. Featured design patterns include the Strategy, Adapter, Observer, and Decorator patterns. Elisabeth and Eric lend these concepts a real-world context by providing code demos in Java, with the occasional example in Python and JavaScript.
